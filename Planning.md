**Initial Plan**

- Will begin by creating and desiging a basic website with the mentioned webpages and will implement localStorage
- Once the initial website is created, will need to gather more information from the potential 3rd party delivering service
- Then we will need to find a way to have the inventory show up on the website. Potentially write code that can read inventory orders and can update the website accordingly
- Then we will implement the delivering service into the website
- Once the delivery service has been implemented, we will begin implementing security aspects to keep user's data safe
- We will then go back and improve the design of the website
- We will then test the website extenisvely
- Next we will focus on translating into a mobile app
